HELLO ANGULAR
=============

Welcome to your first Angular tutorial. You should have already done some reading, maybe watched a few YouTubes about
AngularJS. As you may have noticed, there are lots of different code styles for Angular (and JS in general). You will
be using my preferences :).

You can also visit the Google Drive bookshelf to read some books about Angular (ask Mitch where it is).

OK, let's get started. First thing to do is make sure you have an environment set up for doing easy web development. 
You'll be learning a critical skill in this section: using Google and StackOverflow. These are a programmer's two
best friends.

On to the dev environment...

WEBSERVER SETUP
===============

(NOTE: In the past I had students set up a local Apache webserver either thru MAMP on the Mac or LAMP on Ubuntu. We really don't need that anymore since WebStorm has a microserver installed and there are NodeJS based solutions as well. So skip this part.)

If you want to set up a local Apache webserver, checkout the APACHE.MD.




 PROJECT SETUP
 =============
 
 Have a Google hangout with Mitch on setting up the project in Webstorm. Make sure he sets you up with in-Webstorm
 debugging using the JetBrains plug in and also shows you how to do debugging through the Javascript console.

 You're going to learn some simple stuff here:
 1) How to do the most basic of AngularJS apps
 2) How the DOM and the JS work together via $scope binding

 TODO
 ====
 
 1. When the Dude button is clicked, append "Dude" after the name.
 2. Add a input box and button to add items to the shopping list.
 3. Add a button to each item in the shopping list to remove from the list
 4. When the list is empty, it should say "Nothing in list".
 Extra Credit. Use ngAnimate to animate the filtering of the list with opacity transitions.
